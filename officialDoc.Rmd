# Introduction

It is undeniable that movies and films are one of the most beloved forms of entertainment across the modern world, especially so in the United States as it is the home of Hollywood. The medium of film has grown into a truly massive industry in the United States and film producers risk devastating losses should a major motion picture be a major flop. As a result, predictions of consumer satisfaction are vital to the success of the industry. An ability to predict how well received a movie will be based on its characteristics or other quantifiable attributes could remove a great deal of the financial risk involved in this industry. Likewise, aggregating movies based on their characteristics may provide new insights into the industry itself.

# Data Description

The data set we set out to investigate was found on Kaggle: . Originally, the data was scraped from the online movie review and informational website IMDB. There are 7,668 movies in the data set from the years 1986 to 2020. Since IMDb are a US-based metric, we decided to eliminate the movies that were not created in the United States in order to hopefully gain a clearer insight into our nation's domestic movie industry. We also decided to remove any rows that contained any NA values. In total, we examined 4,325 movies after cleaning the data. See Figure \@ref(fig:dataTable)

```{r dataTable, fig.cap="Attributes of 'Movie Industry' Data", fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,out.width='50%',out.height='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("plots/dataTable.png")
```

--[IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT DATASET]--

It is also important to discuss the presence of NAs in this dataset. There were many rows with NAs left over after isolating the data to [].

--[ANSWER QUESTION 2]--

# Research Questions

1. What are the strongest predictors of IMDb score; that is, are there variables that strongly predict if a movie will be well received by audiences? 

2. How can we group movies together that contain similar attributes so that we can recommend similar movies to others?

# Data Visualization

```{r histBudget, fig.cap='Histogram of Budget (red dashed line represents division between "low" and "high" budget films)', fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,out.width='80%',out.height='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("plots/histBudget.png")
```

See figure \@ref(fig:bothBox)

```{r yearBudget, eval = FALSE, fig.cap='Boxplot of Year vs Budget', echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,out.width='100%',out.height='50%'}
# LEGACY
knitr::include_graphics("plots/boxplotYearBudget.png")
```

```{r scoreBudget, eval = FALSE, fig.cap='Boxplot of Score vs Budget', echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,out.width='100%',out.height='50%'}
# LEGACY
knitr::include_graphics("plots/boxplotScoreBudget.png")
```

```{r bothBox, fig.cap='Boxplot of Year vs. Budget and Boxplot of Score vs. Budget', fig.show = 'hold', fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,out.width='49%',out.height='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("plots/boxplotYearBudget.png", "plots/boxplotScoreBudget.png"))
```

see figure \@ref(fig:bothBox)

```{r scoreVotesCorr, fig.cap='Correlation matrix of Score and Votes', fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,out.width='50%',out.height='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("plots/scoreVotesCorr.png")
```

[ANSWER QUESTION #1]

# Data Analysis/Results

## Multiple Regression

```{r residuals1, eval = FALSE, fig.cap='Residual Plots for Initial Model', echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,out.width='60%',out.height='70%'}
# LEGACY
knitr::include_graphics("plots/residuals1.png")
```

```{r residualsFinal, eval = FALSE, fig.cap='Residual Plots for Final Model', echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,out.width='60%',out.height='70%'}
# LEGACY
knitr::include_graphics("plots/residualsFinal.png")
```

```{r residualsPlots, fig.cap='Full model residuals plots (left) and final model residuals plots (right)', fig.show = 'hold', fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,out.width='49%',out.height='65%'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("plots/residuals1.png", "plots/residualsFinal.png"))
```
