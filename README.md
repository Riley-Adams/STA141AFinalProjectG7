# Analysis of Movies

In this project, which was a final project for a course called STA 141A: Fundamental of Statistical Data Science, 
we used R to conduct an analysis about on a large set of movie office data. We explored the following research questions: 

* What are the strongest predictors of IMDb score; that is, are there variables that strongly predict if a movie will be well received by audiences?

* How can we group movies together that contain similar attributes so that we can recommend similar movies to others?

To address the first question, we implemented a multiple regression linear model. 
For the second question, we implemented hierarchical clustering methods.
